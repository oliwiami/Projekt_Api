# Projekt_Api

An API project for my IT classes.

### Opis

This API connects to a database, which contains a list of books that are currently in my posession. Each books has a describtion along with a rating. 
There are several routes to look for books by id, author or title. Additionally you can create, delete and login to a user account.
